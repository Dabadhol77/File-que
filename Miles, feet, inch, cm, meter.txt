# Python program to convert and print a distance in miles, feet, inch, cm, meter

# Take user input for distance in miles
distance_miles = float(input("Enter distance in miles: "))

# Convert miles to feet, inches, centimeters, and meters
distance_feet = distance_miles * 5280
distance_inches = distance_miles * 63360
distance_cm = distance_miles * 160934.4
distance_meter = distance_miles * 1609.344

# Print the converted distances
print(f"{distance_miles} miles = {distance_feet} feet")

print(f"{distance_miles} miles = {distance_cm} centimeters")
